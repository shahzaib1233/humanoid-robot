# Introduction Case Study: ASIMO - Pioneer in Humanoid Robotics

This case study examines Honda's ASIMO (Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility), one of the most well-known humanoid robots that demonstrated many fundamental concepts of Physical AI and humanoid robotics.

## Background and Development

Honda began developing ASIMO in the 1980s as part of their research into bipedal locomotion and human-robot interaction. The project aimed to create a robot capable of safely interacting with humans in their natural environment.

### Timeline of Development
- **1986-1991**: Initial research on bipedal walking with E0, E1-E3 series
- **1996-1997**: P2 series achieved autonomous walking
- **1997-2000**: P3 series became the first practical bipedal robot
- **2000-2011**: ASIMO series with significant improvements
- **2011**: Advanced ASIMO with enhanced capabilities

## Physical Design and Specifications

### Mechanical Structure
- **Height**: 130 cm (4 ft 3 in)
- **Weight**: 48 kg (106 lb)
- **Degrees of Freedom**: 57 total
  - 6 DOF in each leg
  - 7 DOF in each arm
  - 3 DOF in the head
  - 12 DOF in the hands (6 per hand)

### Actuation System
ASIMO used electric servo motors for all joints, with special emphasis on:
- High-torque motors for legs to support bipedal walking
- Precise control motors for arms to enable fine manipulation
- Compact design to maintain human-like proportions

### Sensor Suite
ASIMO incorporated multiple sensor systems:
