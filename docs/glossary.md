# Glossary

This glossary contains definitions of key terms used throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## A

### Actuator
A component of a machine responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system.

### Adaptive Control
A control system that adjusts its parameters in real-time to accommodate changes in the system or environment.

## B

### Balance Control
The process of maintaining a robot's center of mass within its support polygon to prevent falling.

### Bipedal Locomotion
Walking on two legs, a key capability for humanoid robots.

## C

### Capture Point
A point on the ground where a robot should step to stop its motion safely.

### Control Theory
A field of engineering and mathematics that deals with the behavior of dynamical systems with inputs.

## D

### Degrees of Freedom (DOF)
The number of independent movements a mechanical system can make.

### Dynamic Balance
Maintaining balance during movement through active control.

## E

### Embodied Cognition
The theory that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the world.

## H

### Humanoid Robot
A robot with a human-like body structure, typically including a head, torso, arms, and legs.

## I

### Inverse Kinematics
The mathematical process of calculating joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position.

### IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
A device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes magnetic field.

## K

### Kinematics
The study of motion without considering the forces that cause the motion.

## L

### Locomotion
The ability to move from one place to another.

## M

### Machine Learning
A type of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### Motion Planning
The process of breaking down a desired movement task into discrete movements.

## P

### Physical AI
Artificial intelligence systems that interact with and operate in the physical world.

### Proprioception
The sense of the relative position of one's own parts of the body and strength of effort being employed in movement.

## R

### Reinforcement Learning
A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards.

### Robot Operating System (ROS)
A flexible framework for writing robot software, providing services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster.

## S

### Sensorimotor Integration
The combination of sensory input with motor output in a coordinated manner.

### Simulation-to-Reality Transfer
The process of transferring skills or behaviors learned in simulation to real-world physical systems.

### Static Balance
Maintaining balance without movement by keeping the center of mass within the support polygon.

## Z

### Zero Moment Point (ZMP)
A criterion for stable walking in humanoid robots, where the sum of moments of the ground reaction forces equals zero.
