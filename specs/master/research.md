# Research Plan: Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Research Areas and Decisions

### 1. Choice of Simulation Platforms
**Decision**: ROS 2 vs. alternative middleware systems for robot control
**Rationale**: ROS 2 is more established with a larger community, but alternatives may offer easier setup or specific functionality
**Alternatives considered**:
- ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)
- ROS 1 (legacy, but still used)
- Gazebo simulation environment
- Unity Robotics
- Webots
- CoppeliaSim

**Research tasks**:
- Compare ROS 2 vs. alternatives for humanoid robot simulation
- Evaluate setup complexity and learning curve
- Assess community support and documentation
- Analyze performance and capabilities for humanoid robots

### 2. Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
**Decision**: Simple Q-learning vs. advanced deep reinforcement learning
**Rationale**: Q-learning is simpler, but deep reinforcement learning offers better scalability and complex decision-making for humanoid robots
**Alternatives considered**:
- Q-learning
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Actor-Critic methods
- Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)

**Research tasks**:
- Compare algorithm complexity vs. performance trade-offs
- Evaluate applicability to humanoid robot control
- Assess implementation difficulty for educational purposes
- Analyze computational requirements

### 3. Voice Command Integration
**Decision**: OpenAI Whisper vs. other speech-to-text systems
**Rationale**: Whisper offers state-of-the-art performance, but may require more resources; alternatives may be less powerful but more resource-efficient
**Alternatives considered**:
- OpenAI Whisper
- Google Speech-to-Text API
- Microsoft Azure Speech
- Mozilla DeepSpeech
- Vosk
- Sphinx

**Research tasks**:
- Compare accuracy and performance of different STT systems
- Evaluate resource requirements and deployment options
- Assess educational value and implementation complexity
- Analyze cost considerations for different platforms
