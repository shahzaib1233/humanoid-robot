# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Decisions Requiring Documentation

### 1. Choice of Simulation Platform
**Status**: Needs ADR
**Impact**: Long-term consequences for development, learning curve, and community support
**Alternatives**: ROS 2 vs. alternatives (Unity, Webots, Gazebo)
**Rationale**: This decision affects how students will learn and implement robot control concepts

**Suggested ADR Title**: "Selection of Simulation Platform for Humanoid Robot Education"

### 2. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Selection
**Status**: Needs ADR
**Impact**: Affects complexity of learning materials and practical applications
**Alternatives**: Simple Q-learning vs. advanced deep reinforcement learning
**Rationale**: This decision impacts the depth of content and student learning progression

**Suggested ADR Title**: "Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Choice for Educational Content"

### 3. Voice Command Integration System
**Status**: Needs ADR
**Impact**: Affects accessibility and user interaction features in examples
**Alternatives**: OpenAI Whisper vs. other STT systems
**Rationale**: This decision impacts resource requirements and educational examples

**Suggested ADR Title**: "Speech-to-Text System for Humanoid Robot Interaction Examples"

### 4. Docusaurus Configuration and Theme
**Status**: Needs ADR
**Impact**: Affects user experience and accessibility of educational content
**Alternatives**: Different themes, plugins, and customization options
**Rationale**: This decision impacts how students interact with the textbook

**Suggested ADR Title**: "Docusaurus Theme and Configuration for Educational Platform"

### 5. Content Organization Strategy
**Status**: Needs ADR
**Impact**: Affects learning progression and content discoverability
**Alternatives**: Different organizational approaches (by complexity, by application, by theory)
**Rationale**: This decision impacts how effectively students can navigate and learn

**Suggested ADR Title**: "Content Organization Strategy for Physical AI Textbook"

### 6. Assessment and Exercise Format
**Status**: Needs ADR
**Impact**: Affects how students validate their learning
**Alternatives**: Different types of exercises (theoretical, practical, project-based)
**Rationale**: This decision impacts the educational effectiveness of the textbook

**Suggested ADR Title**: "Assessment Strategy for Physical AI and Robotics Textbook"
