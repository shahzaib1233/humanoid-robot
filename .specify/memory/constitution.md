# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Comprehensiveness
Cover key concepts in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics with depth and breadth. All major topics must be thoroughly explained with theoretical foundations, practical applications, and real-world examples. Content must provide sufficient detail for readers to understand and implement concepts.

### II. Clarity and Accessibility
Make content accessible for all learners, avoiding excessive jargon while maintaining technical precision. Complex concepts must be broken down into digestible parts with clear explanations, analogies, and visual aids. All content must target Flesch-Kincaid grade level 12-14.

### III. Reproducibility and Verification (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Ensure practical examples and algorithms are replicable with detailed step-by-step instructions, complete code samples, and expected outcomes. All claims must be verified through primary sources with proper citations in APA format. Zero plagiarism tolerance enforced.

### IV. Evidence-Based Content
All technical claims must be supported by peer-reviewed sources, with at least 40% of minimum 30 required sources being peer-reviewed. Primary sources preferred over secondary interpretations. Content must distinguish between established facts, theoretical concepts, and emerging research.

### V. Engagement and Practical Application
Include real-world examples, case studies, and hands-on exercises throughout the textbook. Each chapter must contain practical applications, problem sets, and projects that reinforce learning objectives. Content must connect theory to practice effectively.

### VI. Visual Learning Support
Integrate diagrams, tables, and visual aids to enhance comprehension of complex concepts. All figures must be clearly labeled, professionally designed, and accompanied by descriptive captions. Visual elements must support and enhance textual content, not replace it.

## Academic Standards

### Content Requirements
- Word count: 40,000-50,000 words across 8-10 chapters
- Minimum 30 sources with at least 40% peer-reviewed
- Each chapter includes exercises and practical applications
- Content formatted for Docusaurus deployment to GitHub Pages
- Expert review required before final publication

### Quality Assurance
- All content undergoes plagiarism checking with 0% tolerance
- Technical accuracy verified by subject matter experts
- Peer review process for each chapter before completion
- Consistency in terminology, notation, and style maintained throughout
- Regular fact-checking and source verification

## Development Workflow

### Writing Standards
- All content written in Markdown format for Docusaurus
- Consistent citation format using APA style throughout
- Chapter outlines approved before detailed writing begins
- Regular progress reviews and milestone checkpoints
- Collaborative review process with multiple subject matter experts

### Review Process
- Technical review by humanoid robotics and AI experts
- Academic review for accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness
- Peer review by educators in the field
- Beta testing with target audience (hackathon participants)
- Final editorial review for consistency and quality

## Governance

This constitution governs all aspects of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook development. All contributors must adhere to these principles and standards. Amendments require documentation of changes, justification for modifications, and approval by the project leadership team. All content must be reviewed for compliance with these standards before inclusion in the final publication.

Academic integrity is paramount - all sources must be properly cited, all claims verified, and all content original or appropriately attributed. Violation of academic standards results in immediate revision requirements.
